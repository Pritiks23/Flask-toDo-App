# Flask-toDo-App
Implemented a ToDo service layer and controller with full CRUD functionality, connecting backend routes to HTML templates for user interaction via forms and buttons.

Created a service layer to manage ToDo items (add, update, delete, get by ID, list all).
Built controller routes to handle user actions (listing, adding, editing, updating, and deleting ToDos).
Connected the backend to HTML templates so users can interact with the app through forms and buttons.
Enabled full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for ToDo items.
